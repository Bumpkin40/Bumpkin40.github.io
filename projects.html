                <h3>March 2023 Update</h5> 
                <p>Since the last update more than 3 years ago, there have been a lot of new features added and improvements made to make development more sustainable.</p>
                <h4>Automated Testing</h4>
                <b>Testing Additions</b>
                <p>As of today, there are 961 automated tests.</p>
                
                <b>Test Coverage</b>
                <p>There was previously no tests because this was "just a personal project".  However, as the amount of code grew, it became obvious that automated testing was required for progress to be made.  Tst coverage has been increased from 0% -> 35.5%.  Which is still not ideal coverage, but better than nothing.</p>
                
                <b>Test Driven Development Employed</b>
                <p>In order to further improve the test coverage, Test-Drivern Development is continuosly being.</p>
                
                <b>CI/CD Pipelines</b>
                <p>To ensure the tests are passing, CI/CD pipelines were created.</p>
                
                <h4>Item Interactions</h4>
                <p>Both players and NPCs can pick up items and throw them.  Players get a preview of the trajectory of their items.</p>

                <b>AI was improved</b>
                <p>to make gameplay more fun to the player.  At the moment, it's pretty basic and is just used to make it harder for the player to reach the end of the level.</p>
                
                <b>Hierarchical State Machines</b>
                <p>AI was added which uses Hierarchical State Machines to make their behvavior predictable.</p>
